# Real-Estate-Price-Analysis-Visualization
This project scrapes real estate property listings from a dynamically rendered website using Selenium. The collected data is cleaned and structured using Pandas, including price, location, area, and BHK details. The final dataset is saved as a CSV for further analysis or modeling.
